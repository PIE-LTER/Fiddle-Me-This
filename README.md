# Fiddle-Me-This
Lesson plan for grades 9 â€“ 12 in which students will analyze various types of models to draw conclusions about fiddler crabs and their role in ecosystems. The goal of this activity is to address the following guiding questions: How has the fiddler crab population range been affected by climate change?

This lesson was developed based on research by David Samuel Johnson. It was developed by four high school teachers participating in the 2016 Museum Institute for Teaching Science Summer Institute.
